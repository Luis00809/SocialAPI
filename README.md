   ## Installation

   ## Usage
   
  The first step to use this app is to install the proper dependencies, mongoose & express. Then be sure to have MongoDB installed to see the database and insomnia to see the express routes. Once those are installed, a user can then create a user, add some thoughts and leave reactions using the proper route.

  Here is a walkthough for starting the database: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I-Zs9Rz_T9a_hO-UaECnfPgq41wI7TIe/view
